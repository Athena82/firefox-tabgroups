# 0.2.0

## Features

* Added a migration override so tab groups won't be migrated away.
* Added compatiblity with Quicksavers Tab Groups add-on.

## Refactorings

* `minVersion` is now set to 44 so people have a chance to install the addon before the migration kicks in.
* `Tab Groups` was renamed to `Simplified Tab Groups` to avoid confusion and conflicts with other add-ons.
* Simpilified development by adding `jake` and some basic scripts.
